It should have been the end of his meager 37 years, but he found himself deaf and blind after hearing a mysterious voice. He had been reincarnated into a slime!\n\nWhile complaining about becoming the weak but famous slime and enjoying the life of a slime at the same time, Mikami Satoru met with the Catastrophe-level monster “Storm Dragon Veldora”, and his fate began to move."
